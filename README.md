# Migration Playground: ADO vs GHA 

This is a proof-of-concept (POC) project demonstrating CI/CD capabilities and security integration using Azure DevOps Pipelines and GitHub Actions. The project is generated by Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4) because the application itself is not a part of my objectives.

### Vulnerabilities

Each branch contains different types of seeded vulnerabilities. In the Pull Requests tab, you can find the results of security scans and Copilot suggestions. The analysis and summarised results are included in relevant documents.
